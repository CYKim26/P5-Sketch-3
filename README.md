# P5-Sketch-3 Variables
## A call to random
My g variable for my rgb green value used the random function.

## A variable used to track a change over time
I created a variable "dir" for "direction" to track the direction of change so that I could determine whether my b variable for my rbg blue value should increase or decrease. 

## A variable used to store an intermediate value
My varibale "dir" also stores the direciton of the the change of the b variable.

## A combination of variables used to refer to the same thing (x,y coordinates, r,g,b values, etc.)
I used r,g,b values.
