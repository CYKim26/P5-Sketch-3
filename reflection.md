# **P5 Sketch 3 Reflection (Persistence and Movement)**
For this sketch, I took my Avenues Logo sketch from my P5 Sketch 2 assignment and added new variables to do new things including creating a oscilatting color effect to the black sides of the logo and add a rotational/radial "reveal" effect. The most challenging part of using variables in this sketch was determining where I should define them so that the logic and order of my code worked. When I was working on the changing color effect, I had the most trouble with trying to get the blue value of my sketch to increase to 255 and then count down in the opposite direction to 0 where it would then continue oscillating back and forth. I was able to solve this with my variable "dir" denoting "direction" in order to change the direction in which the variable changed (increased or decreased) depending on whether the blue value had reached 255 or 0.
